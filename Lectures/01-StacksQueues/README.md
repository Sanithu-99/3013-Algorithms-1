## Review - Stacks & Queues
#### Due: N/A 

### Topics
- On day one we discussed:
    - Stacks
    - Queues

- Both of these data structures use `push` & `pop`, but differ in the order in which things are removed. 
  - A stack is `LIFO`
  - A queue is `FIFO`

### Stack
- We add things to a `stack` by placing each item on top of the previous item.
- We remove items from a `stack` by taking the item that is at the top of the `stack` (the last thing to pushed).

### Queue
- We add things to a `queue` by placing each item at the end of the queue (at the rear).
- We remove items from a `queue` by taking the item that is at the front of the `queue` (the item that has been in the queue the longest).

### Container Types

What differentiates a `stack` or a `queue` is the order in which we remove items from the data structure (as mentioned above). However, both of these data structures can be implemented using one of the following: 

- Array
- List

Arrays vs Lists is an entirely different discussion, which I will post at another time.
