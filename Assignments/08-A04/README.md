## Assignment A04 - Presentations

#### Due: 04-21-2023 (Friday @ 10:00 a.m.)

### Overview

Since we burned through the list of algorithms that I typically cover, we are going to finish out the semester going over algorithms of your choosing. I had you send me your choice previously to see what the class would come up with, and I think as a whole, they were interesting. I want you to prepare a presentation to discuss your algorithm in front of class. It should last at least 15 minutes. The materials you cover may be on the final exam, so you want to be clear for the benefit of your classmates.

### Presentation

What does your presentation need to cover?

- Name of the algorithm
- Category (greedy, recursive, brute force, etc.)
- General description of what the algorithm does or its purpose
- A walkthrough describing the steps in the algorithm
- The time and space complexity of the algorithm

- Images and graphics in general are recommended, but not mandatory. Power point is also recommended, but not mandatory. If you can discuss the algorithm thoroughly just using the board, then go for it.

### Handouts

Prepare a one page summary of your presentation that includes all relevant information. It can be front and back. The handouts are study material for your classmates.

### Deliverables

- Create a folder in your `Assignments` folder called `A04`.
- Place all your materials in the folder that you used for your presentation if any.
- If you don't have any presentation slides or materials, then place a thorough description / outline of your presentation in the README file.
- Everyone must be ready by this Friday (21st) and I will randomly choose
