You are developing an application for a restaurant that manages table reservations. The restaurant has a limited number of tables, and customers can reserve a table based on the number of seats they need. The restaurant try's to fit multiple parties together when it can, and favors small parties. Which data structure would you use to efficiently allocate the tables?

You are designing a program to analyze the frequency of words in a large text file. Which data structure would you use to efficiently count the occurrences of each word in the file?

You are implementing a network routing protocol that should efficiently find the shortest path between any two routers in a network. The latency between routers can be considered as edge weights in a graph. Which type of algorithm would be more suitable to use for finding the shortest path between any two routers?

 You are designing a text editor that allows users to undo and redo their actions. The editor should support navigating through the history of actions in a forward and backward manner. Which type of linked list implementation would be most suitable for storing the history of actions?



int i = 1;
while(i < n){
    // perform constant-time operation
    i = i * 2;
}

O(N)


You are designing an application to manage a collection of customer orders. The application should efficiently support inserting new orders, deleting orders with the highest priority, and querying the order with the highest priority. Which data structure would you use for this purpose?


You are developing a traffic management application that should determine the quickest route for emergency vehicles between any two locations in a city. The travel time between locations can be represented as edge weights in a graph. Which type of algorithm would be more suitable to use for finding the quickest route between two locations?
