## Assignment 1 - Database Indexes ... What?!?
#### Due: 02-24-2023 (Friday @ 10:00 a.m.)

### Overview

Using `random_person_data` we created using Mockaroo, build a data structure that can search for data using a minimum of 8 of the 16 values in `O(lg n)` time. Your choice of data structure will obviously effect how fast you can find records, so choose wisely. Below is a list of the data elements and types stored in the json files generated by mockaroo.

```cpp
int id
string first_name
string last_name
string email
string address
string city
string state
double latitude
double longitude
string car
string car_model
string car_color
string pet
string job_title
string phone_number
vector <string> stocks
```
Most of these data elements are easily sorted and made searchable. The one pair of values that would give us trouble knowing what we know up to now are the two doubles representing latitude and longitude. Think for a minute how you would try to search using a pair of GPS coordinates :) I added a paper to this folder if your interested in reading about the [first data structure](R-Tree-Guttman.pdf) created for spatial values (points, lines, polygons)!


### Example Run
https://replit.com/@rugbyprof/3013P01Something#main.cpp
```
Searching for "Park" in BST by address ...
Compared "Park" to 235 nodes ... 
Found in 0.023 seconds

Searching for "Park" in LL by address ...
Compared "Park" to 566 nodes ... 
Found in 2.023 seconds


Plus at least one search per tree ....



```

## Data

- https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/data/3013_random_data/random_person_data_small.json 
- https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/data/3013_random_data/random_person_data_01.json 

## Deliverables

- Make a folder called P01 in your assignments folder.
- Add all of your source code to this folder. 
- Output file or screen dump.
- Don't forget your banner.
- README.md with an explanation of your approach to the problem
