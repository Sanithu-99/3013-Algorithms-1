**Problem:** Implement a binary tree data structure and compare the performance of an unbalanced tree versus a balanced tree for various operations.

**Project Description:**
1. **Implementation:** 
   - Implement a simple binary tree data structure with operations for insertion, deletion, and searching.
   - Implement a balanced tree data structure such as an AVL tree or a Red-Black tree.
   
2. **Experiment:**
   - Generate random datasets of different sizes.
   - Perform a series of operations (e.g., insertions, deletions, searches) on both the unbalanced tree and the balanced tree using the same datasets.
   - Measure and compare the execution times for each operation on both tree structures.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Analyze and compare the performance of the unbalanced tree and the balanced tree for various operations.
   - Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each tree structure.
   - Provide insights into the importance of balancing in maintaining efficient tree operations, especially for large datasets.

**Expected Learning Outcomes:**
- Understanding the concepts of balanced and unbalanced trees.
- Practical experience in implementing and comparing tree data structures.
- Appreciation for the impact of data structure choice on algorithm performance.

This project will allow students to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of balanced trees and how they can significantly improve the performance of tree-based operations. It also provides an opportunity for hands-on experimentation and analysis, which are valuable skills in computer science.
