### Example Questions

- For everything you do on this test, know its complexity.
- Be able to write a basic sorting routine like a bubble sort or selection sort and know the difference between them.
- Given an array, perform a binary search to find a specific key.
- Describe the difference between searching:
  - a list
  - an array
  - an ordered list
  - an ordered array
  - a bst (binary search)

- ~~Heap~~
  - ~~What is it?~~
  - ~~What can it be used for?~~
  - ~~Describe the difference between inserting items into a heap and building a heap from an array of values~~

- Priority Queue
  - What is it?
  - What can it be used for?
  <br>
- Given a list of unordered numbers, load them into an array based binary search tree
- Given a list of unordered numbers, load them into a binary search tree
- Given a list of unordered numbers, load them into a ~~heap~~ priority queue.
<br>
- ~~Delete a value from a given binary tree~~
- ~~Write a recursive traversal of a binary search tree.~~ 
- ~~Do an inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal of a tree.~~
